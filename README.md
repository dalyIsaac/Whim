## Automatic Updating

The `Whim.Updater` plugin is in `alpha` (especially as Whim hasn't started releasing non-`alpha` builds). If the updater fails, you can manually update Whim by downloading the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/dalyIsaac/Whim/releases).

The updater will show a notification when a new version is available. Clicking on the notification will show the changelog for the delta between the current version and the latest version.

The `UpdaterConfig` supports specifying the `ReleaseChannel` and `UpdateFrequency`.
