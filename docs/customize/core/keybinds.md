# Keybinds

The keybinds configuration has a list of bindings that you can use to bind commands to key combinations.

## Bindings

A key modifier is a key that is pressed in combination with another key to perform a specific action. The `bindings` property is a list of keybinds that map a command to a key combination.

Key modifiers can be any of the following:

- `Ctrl`
- `Control`
- `LCtrl`
- `LControl`
- `RCtrl`
- `RControl`
- `Shift`
- `LShift`
- `RShift`
- `Alt`
- `LAlt`
- `RAlt`
- `Win`
- `LWin`
- `RWin`

The associated key for each modifier can be any of the <xref:Windows.Win32.UI.Input.KeyboardAndMouse.VIRTUAL_KEY>s.

## Commands

A command is a string that represents a command that can be executed by Whim. The command can be a built-in command, a plugin command, or a custom command. For more, see the [Commands](commands.md) page.

## Unify Key Modifiers

To treat key modifiers like `LWin` and `RWin` the same, set `unify_key_modifiers` to `true`.

## Keybinds Example

```yaml
keybinds:
  entries:
    - command: whim.core.focus_next_monitor
      keybind: LCtrl+LShift+LAlt+K

    - command: whim.core.focus_previous_monitor
      keybind: LCtrl+LShift+LAlt+J

    - command: whim.custom.next_layout_engine
      keybind: LCtrl+LShift+LAlt+L

    - command: whim.core.cycle_layout_engine.next
      keybind: LCtrl+LShift+LAlt+L

    - command: whim.core.cycle_layout_engine.previous
      keybind: LCtrl+LShift+LAlt+Win+L

    - command: whim.command_palette.find_focus_window
      keybind: Win+LCtrl+F

    - command: whim.core.exit_whim
      keybind: Win+LCtrl+Q

  unify_key_modifiers: true
```
