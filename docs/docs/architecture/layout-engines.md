# Layout Engines

A "layout engine" or <xref:Whim.ILayoutEngine> in Whim is responsible for arranging windows in a workspace. Each workspace has a single active layout engine, and can cycle through different layout engines.

There are two different types of layout engines:

- proxy layout engines
- leaf layout engines

**Proxy layout engines** wrap other engines, and can be used to modify the behavior of other engines. For example, the [`Gaps` plugin](../plugins/gaps.md) will add gaps between windows - normally layout engines won't leave gaps between windows.

**Leaf layout engines** are the lowest level layout engines, and are responsible for actually arranging windows.
