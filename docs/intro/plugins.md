# Plugins

Whim is built around plugins. They provide additional functionality to Whim, such as a bar, floating windows, or a command palette.

Plugins can be customized via both YAML/JSON configuration and C# scripting. Plugins are loaded as required by Whim based on the configuration. If a plugin was loaded by the YAML/JSON configuration, it will be loaded automatically and does not need to be added to the `PluginManager` - see [YAML/JSON and C# Integration](../script/snippets.md#yamljson-and-c-integration).
